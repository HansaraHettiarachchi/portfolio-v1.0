## ▶️ Run locally (Windows / PowerShell)

Make sure you have Node.js installed (recommended LTS). Then in the project root run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Start dev server: `npm run dev` (uses Vite)
- Build for production: `npm run build` (runs TypeScript build and Vite build)

These scripts come from the project's `package.json`.
